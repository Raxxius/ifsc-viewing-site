# International Federation of Sports Climbing competition viewing website

This projects goals are to design, develop and launch a website for viewing International Federation of Sports Climbing (IFSC) events, while providing information on the active climbers and a score in realtime.

Events videos are hosted on YouTube, and YouTube will be the source of the videos. Additional functionality from YouTube will be required to enhance the viewer experience.
